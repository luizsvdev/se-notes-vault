# 5.1 What is UX and UI?
UX and UI are different jobs, but they are correlated

- UX is the total *User Experience* along with the product or services
- UI is the *User Interface* that will provide a pleasant and aligned interface, in which the user recognizes what is the task being performed

## UX in software and applications
- All contact with the product must be considered
	- How to find the balance point between the user needs and the business needs
- The experience must be focused on use, usability and desirability

# 5.2 Knowing your User
- We need to know our user, your motivations, frustrations and desires of the people who we are creating something for
- Understand how to connect the user and what is his impact in the product and/or service we are developing

## Desirability, Viability and Feasibility
An awesome product/service emerges from the union of these three: 

- **Desirability**:
  If there is demand or interest for what is being purposed
- **Viability**:
  If it makes sense financially and strategically
- **Feasibility**:
  If the organization or team has the resources, knowledge, and the structure necessary to develop the idea
