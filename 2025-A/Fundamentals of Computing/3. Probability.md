## 3.1 Probability Concept  

#### Sample Space  

Sample space is a way to represent probabilities. Consider the following:  

- There are two computer components: the **Motherboard** and the **Graphics Card**.  
- What is the probability that these components are defective?  
- We need a way to represent this scenario.  
- The **Motherboard** can be either defective or working.  
- The **Graphics Card** can also be either defective or working.  

Thus, we can define the sample space as:  

$D = \text{Defective}$
$W = \text{Working}$

$$S = \{DD, DW, WD, WW\}$$
