## 3.1 Probability Concept  

### Simple Probability Calculation
#### Explanation
A supermarket shelf contains **100** products of a certain brand. After checking the expiration dates, it is observed that **15** of these products are expired.

The objective is to determine the probability of randomly selecting an expired product from the shelf.

#### Formula
The probability of an event \( A \) occurring is given by the formula:

$$P(A) = \frac{n}{N}$$

Where:
- $P(A)$ represents the probability of the event occurring.
- $n$ denotes the number of favorable outcomes (expired products).
- $N$ represents the total number of possible outcomes (all products on the shelf).

#### Calculation
Substituting the values:

$$P(A) = \frac{15}{100}$$

$$P(A) = 0.15$$

Converting to percentage:

$$P(A) = 15\%$$


### Sample Space  
#### Explanation
Sample space is a way to represent probabilities. Consider the following:  

- There are two computer components: the **Motherboard** and the **Graphics Card**.  
- What is the probability that these components are defective?  
- We need a way to represent this scenario.  
- The **Motherboard** can be either defective or working.  
- The **Graphics Card** can also be either defective or working.  

Thus, we can define the sample space as: 

#### Formula
$D = \text{Defective}$
$W = \text{Working}$

$$S = \{DD, DW, WD, WW\}$$

## 3.2 Addition rule and multiplication rule

### Events  
#### Mutually Exclusive Events  
Two events are **mutually exclusive** if they cannot happen at the same time.  
For example, rolling a die and getting either a **3** or a **5** (you cannot roll both).  
$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$  

#### Non-Mutually Exclusive Events  
Two events are **non-mutually exclusive** if they can occur together.  
For example, drawing a card that is both **red** and **a King**.  
$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$  

#### Independent Events  
Two events are **independent** if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.  
For example, flipping a coin and rolling a die at the same time.  
$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$  

#### Dependent Events (Conditional Probability)  
Two events are **dependent** if the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other. 
For example, drawing two cards from a deck **without replacement**.  
$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B | A)
$$  
$$ \text{Or equivalently} $$  
$$
P(A \cap B) = P(B) \cdot P(A | B)
$$

### Bayes' Theorem

#### Definition

Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of related conditions. It is given by:

$$P(A∣B)=P(B∣A)⋅P(A)P(B)P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$

#### Explanation of Terms

- **P(A∣B)P(A | B)** → Probability of event **A** occurring given that **B** has already occurred.
- **P(B∣A)P(B | A)** → Probability of event **B** occurring given that **A** has already occurred.
- **P(A)P(A)** → Prior probability of event **A** occurring.
- **P(B)P(B)** → Total probability of event **B** occurring.

#### Example Scenario

Suppose there are two factories, **Factory A** and **Factory B**, producing a certain type of part:

- **Factory A** produces **40%** of the total parts.
- **Factory B** produces **60%** of the total parts.
- **5%** of the parts produced by **Factory A** are defective.
- **2%** of the parts produced by **Factory B** are defective.

Now, if we randomly select a defective part, what is the probability that it came from **Factory A**?

Using Bayes' Theorem:

$$P(A∣D)=P(D∣A)⋅P(A)P(D)P(A | D) = \frac{P(D | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(Defective)}$$

Where:

$$P(D)=P(D∣A)⋅P(A)+P(Defective∣B)⋅P(B)P(D) = P(D | A) \cdot P(A) + P(D | B) \cdot P(B)$$

Substituting values:

$$P(D)=(0.05×0.40)+(0.02×0.60)=0.032P(D) = (0.05 \times 0.40) + (0.02 \times 0.60) = 0.032$$

Finally:

$$P(A∣Defective)=0.05×0.400.032≈0.625P(A | Defective) = \frac{0.05 \times 0.40}{0.032} \approx 0.625$$

Thus, given that a part is defective, the probability that it was produced by **Factory A** is **62.5%**.
