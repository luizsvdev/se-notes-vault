# 3.1 Probability Concept  

## Simple Probability Calculation
#### Explanation
A supermarket shelf contains **100** products of a certain brand. After checking the expiration dates, it is observed that **15** of these products are expired.

The objective is to determine the probability of randomly selecting an expired product from the shelf.

#### Formula
The probability of an event \( A \) occurring is given by the formula:

$$P(A) = \frac{n}{N}$$

Where:
- $P(A)$ represents the probability of the event occurring.
- $n$ denotes the number of favorable outcomes (expired products).
- $N$ represents the total number of possible outcomes (all products on the shelf).

#### Calculation
Substituting the values:

$$P(A) = \frac{15}{100}$$

$$P(A) = 0.15$$

Converting to percentage:

$$P(A) = 15\%$$


## Sample Space  
#### Explanation
Sample space is a way to represent probabilities. Consider the following:  

- There are two computer components: the **Motherboard** and the **Graphics Card**.  
- What is the probability that these components are defective?  
- We need a way to represent this scenario.  
- The **Motherboard** can be either defective or working.  
- The **Graphics Card** can also be either defective or working.  

Thus, we can define the sample space as: 

#### Formula
$D = \text{Defective}$
$W = \text{Working}$

$$S = \{DD, DW, WD, WW\}$$

# 3.2 Addition rule and multiplication rule

## Events  
#### Mutually Exclusive Events  
Two events are **mutually exclusive** if they cannot happen at the same time.  
For example, rolling a die and getting either a **3** or a **5** (you cannot roll both).  
$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$  

#### Non-Mutually Exclusive Events  
Two events are **non-mutually exclusive** if they can occur together.  
For example, drawing a card that is both **red** and **a King**.  
$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$  

#### Independent Events  
Two events are **independent** if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.  
For example, flipping a coin and rolling a die at the same time.  
$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$  

#### Dependent Events (Conditional Probability)  
Two events are **dependent** if the occurrence of one affects the probability of the other. 
For example, drawing two cards from a deck **without replacement**.  
$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B | A)
$$  
$$ \text{Or equivalently} $$  
$$
P(A \cap B) = P(B) \cdot P(A | B)
$$

## Bayes' Theorem

### Definition
Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of related conditions. It is given by:

$$P(A∣B) = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B∣A)}{P(B)}$$

### Explanation of Terms
- $P(A∣B)$ → Probability of event $A$ occurring given that $B$ has already occurred.
- $P(B∣A)$ → Probability of event $B$ occurring given that $A$ has already occurred.
- $P(A)$ → Prior probability of event $A$ occurring.
- $P(B)$ → Total probability of event $B$ occurring.

### Example Scenario
Suppose there are two factories, **Factory A** and **Factory B**, producing a certain type of part:

- **Factory A** produces **40%** of the total parts.
- **Factory B** produces **60%** of the total parts.
- **5%** of the parts produced by **Factory A** are defective.
- **2%** of the parts produced by **Factory B** are defective.

Here is a visualization: [[3.2 Bayes Theorem.canvas|Bayes' Theorem Diagram]]

#### Now, what is the probability that it came from **Factory A**?
Using Bayes' Theorem:

$$P(A\cap D_A) = P(A) \cdot P(D_A)$$
$$P(A\cap D_A) = 0.4 \cdot 0.05$$
$$P(A\cap D_A) = 0.2$$

Thus, the probability that it was produced by **Factory A** is $2\%$.

#### What is the probability that it came from Factory B?
Again, using Bayes' Theorem:

$$P(B\cap D_B) = P(B) \cdot P(D_B)$$
$$P(B\cap D_B) = 0.6 \cdot 0.02$$
$$P(B\cap D_B) = 0.012$$

Thus, the probability that it was produced by **Factory B** is $1.2\%$.

#### What is the probability of a defective part being produced?
$$P(D) = P(A) \cdot P(D_A) \cup P(B) \cdot P(D_B)$$
$$P(D) = 0.4 \cdot 0.05 + 0.6 \cdot 0.02)$$
$$P(D) = 0.02 + 0.012)$$
$$P(D) = 0.032)$$

Thus, the probability of a defective part being produced is $3.2\%$

#### What is the probability that Factory A will produce a defective part?
In this case, we are only seeing defective parts

$$P(A∣D) = \frac{P(A \cap D)}{P(D)}$$
$$
P(A∣D) = \frac{0.04 \cdot 0.05}{0.04 \cdot 0.05 + 0.06 \cdot 0.02}
$$
$$P(A∣D) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.012}$$
$$P(A∣D) = \frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.012}$$
$$P(A∣D) = \frac{0.02}{0.032}$$
$$P(A∣D) = 0.625$$

Thus, the probability that **Factory A** will produce a defective part is $62.5\%$
